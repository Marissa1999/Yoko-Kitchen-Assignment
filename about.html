						     Yoko's Kitchen came about during the early 1970s in London.
							 One day, a young Japanese woman named Yoko Ono was cooking
                             for the first time in her own house kitchen. Finding the freshest 
							 ingredients possible, she decided to concoct her favorite oriental
							 dish: kimchi. As the smell of her cooking filled the entire house,
							 her husband John Lennon came home from a joyful day at the music studio. 
							 He inhaled deeply, breathing in the pleasant fumes of a recipe. With full
							 of peace and love, he came to her and told her, that she'll become a
							 great chef one day. She blushed and thanked him for his kind compliment.
							 As John sat down at the table, he began to read a newspaper about the
							 troubled war incidents in Vietnam. He felt bad, and since he was a peace
                             activist, he wanted to do something about it. Once night came, John was
                             talking to Yoko, about her starting a Japanese restaurant. She agreed and
                             went to sleep. Silently, John went to the telephone and called some of her
                             relatives from Japan. Once he completed his explanation, they all agreed.
                             The next day, Yoko woke up and went to the kitchen. John was already there,
                             preparing a simple English breakfast. He discussed the good news to her, telling
                             that her relatives are planning to open a new restaurant for her. He also told her
                             about the poor people in Vietnam, which he willingly wants to raise money for 
							 charity and peace. Yoko was very delighted and pleased, deciding to call the 
							 restaurant Yoko's Kitchen. And from that day forth, Yoko's Kitchen has been lasting 
							 for at least 50 years, where not only restaurant food is served, but cooking classes 
							 and catering are offered. Yoko Ono managed to hire talented Japanese chefs, who are 
							 fantastic at mastering many Japanese dishes. It gives the chance to enhance the 
							 compassion of many individuals that not only enjoy cooking, but raise awareness 
							 for the poor.
